"# RStudio-Workshop-Materials" 

These materials are being used for general workshop practices. I've used two documents from Dr. Shaley Valentine and have adapted this workshop from their professional website.

I give thanks to those who have made this workshop possible and helping me get a kick start in teaching or assisting in the learning of students and future professionals.


These materials will adapt and change as I (hopefully) conduct future workshops. 

Thanks!

Brittnany :)
